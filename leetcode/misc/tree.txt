a tree can be thought of as a connected acyclic graph with N nodes and N-1 edges.
Any two vertices are connected by exactly one path.

there are 6 possible DFS traversals for binary trees:-

1. left, right, root ( Postorder) ~ 4. right, left, root
2. left, root, right ( Inorder) ~ 5. right, root, left
3. root, left, right ( Preorder) ~ 6. root, right, left

And there is one BFS which is the level order traversal ( can be done using queue). Let us analyze the DFS pattern using a "stack".

BFS --> Queues
DFS --> stack
